# UX Notes

## Home Layout
- Hero: “Total views across your TikTok — in one number.”
- Sub: “Connect your account to see the sum of views across all your videos.”
- Button: “Login with TikTok”
- Card: “Total Views” (Sample: 12,345,678)
- Section: “How it works” (Connect → Sum → See total)

## States
- Pre-login: show sample.
- After login (pre-approval): show message “Awaiting API approval; demo using sample data.”
- After approval: show live total and videos counted.

## Style
- Minimal, friendly. TikTok palette accents only.
