# Privacy Policy (draft)
We do not collect or sell personal information. During pre-approval, this site displays sample data only and does not access your TikTok account. After you choose to connect your account (upon TikTok approval), we will request the minimal scopes needed to read your video list and view counts. Access tokens are used in memory to fetch totals and are not stored server-side by default. No data is shared with third parties. Contact: support@yourdomain.com

# Terms of Service (draft)
This site provides aggregated view totals for your TikTok account. You must be the owner of the connected account. You agree not to misuse the service or attempt to scrape or reverse engineer TikTok. The service is provided “as is” without warranties. Liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. Contact: legal@yourdomain.com
